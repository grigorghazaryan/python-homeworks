# 9. Write a program that uses a dictionary that contains ten user names and passwords. 
# The program should ask the user to enter their username and password. 

# If the username is not in the dictionary, the program should indicate that the person is not a valid user of the system. If
# the username is in the dictionary, but the user does not enter the right password, 
# the program should say that the password is invalid. 

# If the password is correct, then the program should tell the user 
# that they are now logged in to the system.
